## Project Face Generation
## Project Overview

In this project, which is part of Udacity's nanodegree program, we are are using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to train a network on a dataset of faces. Specifically we will define a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) that will be able to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible  


## Getting started

You can review the code and my answers for this project in the dlnd_face_generation.ipynb file

You can also clone the original project and implement your own solution for this project from [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch)

Or simply : 
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
cd deep-learning-v2-pytorch/project-face-generation
```
## Prerequisites
You can see all the prerequisites needed in the requirements.txt file
Or you can install them using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
I used Anaconda to create a virtual environment on Windows OS
You can check how to use Anaconda and virtual environments [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

We will be using the  [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset(CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train our GAN.

You can run and train this network both on CPU and on GPU.
It is suggested to run on GPU in order to speed up the computational time
